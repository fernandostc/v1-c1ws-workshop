## CLOUD ONE WORKLOAD SECURITY

The data center is undergoing a tremendous transformation. Organizations are now moving their server workloads to the cloud, and even leveraging containers and serverless in their cloud-native application architectures. There are many advantages of hybrid cloud computing, however, it also comes with new risks and threats. Your organization must ensure compliance requirements are met, and that you have unified security across all of your workloads such as physical servers, virtual, cloud, or containers.

Trend Micro Cloud One™ – Workload Security provides comprehensive detection and protection in a single solution that is purpose-built for server, cloud, and container environments. Workload Security allows for consistent security, regardless of the workload. It also provides a rich set of application programming interfaces (APIs), so security can be automated and won’t impact your teams.
