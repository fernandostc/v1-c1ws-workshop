### INTRODUCING TREND MICRO ZERO TRUST SECURE ACCESS
As part of Trend Micro Vision One™, Trend Micro Zero Trust Secure Access follows the principles of Zero Trust networking. This strengthens your overall security posture by enforcing strong access control permissions from multiple identity services across the organization.

Instead of granting access to the entire network, as a VPN does, Zero Trust Secure Access provides a gateway to specific applications and resources, restricting access to everything within the network that is not being employed. If valid user credentials are stolen, the level of access they will grant to the organization can be contained, effectively reducing the blast area of any attack.

#### CONTINUOUS RISK ASSESSMENT

As we continue to measure cyber security risk more closely to business risks, we can see that it is not a ‘one and done’ concept.

Indeed, risk is always changing and must be continuously assessed to be useful as a mechanism to improve security posture. Trend Micro Vision One Risk Insights provides that function of continuous risk assessment for Zero Trust Secure Access.

At regular intervals and dynamically in real-time, risk rating data from Risk Insights is used to evaluate current connections between users, devices, and applications. If at any point the risk rating exceeds customizable thresholds, the connection is blocked, and the network is protected against exposure. When the risk returns to within tolerance, the connection can be reestablished, and operations can continue securely.
