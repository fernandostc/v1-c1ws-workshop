In this workshop, you’ll learn how to leverage the Trend Micro Vision One Platform, in conjuction with Cloud One Workload Security, to rapidly detect and respond to suspicious behavior, ransomware, disruption, and critical attacks that have evaded protection technology and proactive risk mitigation measures. 

--------
## Use Cases Covered in this Workshop
With this workshop, you can simulate Real World uses cases like:

> <b>1- </b>Company running important business applications on an EC2 Instance. An administrator by mistake will download and run a 0-day malware that will give the control of the affected computer to attackers. We will show in this demo how C1WS in conjunction with Vision One can help detecting suspicious behaviors related to 0-day attacks, and mitigate/remediate them as soon as they are detected by the Trend Micro components in place.

> <b>More to come..</b>
